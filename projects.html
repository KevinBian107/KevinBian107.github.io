        <h2>Intuitive Laplacien Eigenmap Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            Dimensionality reduction technique is a crucial technique in machine learning as they are an approach in finding the "principals" in high dimensional data, which tends to be very noisy and would affect 
            the accuracy of simple classifier significantly. However, these techniques are usually very mathematically intense and complicated for the general public to understand without prior mathematical background. 
            Therefore, we developed this visualization project using D3, JavaScript to deliver an <strong>intuitive</strong> understanding of one of the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms (<strong>Laplacien Eigenmap</strong>) 
            on the art work collections in MET, New York.

        <h2>Robust Ensemble Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Recipes and ratings play a pivotal role in our everyday lives, influencing various aspects from culinary experiences to social interactions. Predicting users’ preferences is particularly crucial as it enables 
            personalized experiences and enhances efficiency in content discovery. In our analysis, we focus on how to predict user preferences based on various numerical and textual features. Our approach involves employing advanced 
            techniques such as TF-IDF transformation, PCA, and a homogenous ensemble learning method, specifically Random Forest, to construct a reliable multi-class classifier with more <strong>robust</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong> predictions 
            even facing imbalanced datasets, ensuring dependable predictions in scenarios where data distribution is skewed.
