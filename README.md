# Kaiwen (Kevin) Bian

My name is Kaiwen (Kevin) Bian and I am a undergraduate student at UCSD double majoring in **Data Science** & **Cognitive Behavoral Neuroscience** and minoring in **Mathamatics**. I am passionate about making data science and machine learning tools an “bridge” to discovering more in every single scientific field both in academia and in the industry. My passion goes beyond Data Science into fields of Neuroscience, Biology, and Exercise Physiology. I am extremely interested in the intersection between Data Science and Neuroscience for developing systems/algorithms with better performances. I am fluent in both Chinese and English, and open- minded for new ideas and learning opportunities.

# Interships
### Salk Institute Talmo's Lab
_Advisor: Prof. Talmo Pereira_
I am currently working as a undergraduate research intern at [**Talmo's Lab**](https://talmolab.org/) in Salk Institute. I am working on the the VNL project, which is a collaboration between **Salk Institute** and **Harvard University** to create a working Imitation/RL pipeline for generating the “brains” for a virtual rodent. We try to create an integrated Reinforcement Learning system using Jax supported brax and dm_control for establishing an environment, then using Imitation Learning to “learn” behavior of actual rodent.

### UCSD FMP Research Assistent
_Advisor: Prof. Sean Trott_
I am currently researching Affordance Embodied Simulation’s presences in Multimodal models through the UCSD Faculty Mentorship Program (started Sep 2023). We try to improve the reliability of machine learning models through examining the degree of models’ “understanding” of the subtle keys in human languages and how it is used to map the world we know.
