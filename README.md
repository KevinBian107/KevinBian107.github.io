# Kaiwen (Kevin) Bian

My name is Kaiwen (Kevin) Bian and I am a undergraduate student at UCSD double majoring in **Data Science** & **Cognitive Behavoral Neuroscience** and minoring in **Mathamatics**. I am passionate about finding bridges between Data Science and Neuroscience through forms of algorithm and machine learning to help both communities better understand the machines and ourselves. I am fluent in both Chinese and English, and open- minded for new ideas and learning opportunities.

# Interships & Apprenticeships
## Salk Institute
I am currently working as a undergraduate research intern at [Talmo's Lab](https://talmolab.org/) in the Salk Institute. we are working on the the VNL project, a collaboration between Salk Institute and Harvard University aiming to create a working **Imitation Learning** (an advance deep reinforcement learning method) pipeline for creating computational models of the brain using gpu accelerated JAX & Brax

## UCSD FMP Research Assistent
I am currently researching on **Affordance Embodied Simulation’s presences in Multimodal models** through the UCSD Faculty Mentorship Program (started Sep 2023) under the supervision of [Sean Trott](https://seantrott.github.io/). We try to improve the reliability of machine learning models through examining the degree of models’ “understanding” of the subtle keys in human languages and how it is used to map the world we know.

# Projects
## Homogenous Ensemble Learning on Highly Imbalanced Data
Training on large corpus of `recipe` data to analyze the "essential component" of each user's textual input (detecting user preference) by different feature egineering (i.e. TF-IDF textual analysis), then building a homogenous ensemble learning system using random forest to predict user preference (highly unbalanced in this data set).

## Essential Algorithms for Data Science Practices
_Currently Developing_

An educational package demnonstrating fundamental algorithms that is essential to practices in data science, machine learning, and optimization, currently include:
- Search algorithms (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, BellmanFord's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm (Uniform Cost Search), Kruskal's Algorithm, A* Search)
