        <h1>Kaiwen (Kevin) Bian</h1>
        <p>My name is Kaiwen (Kevin) Bian and I am a undergraduate student at UCSD double majoring in 
          <strong>Data Science</strong> & <strong>Cognitive Behavoral Neuroscience</strong> and minoring in <strong>Mathamatics</strong>. I am passionate 
          about finding bridges between Data Science and Neuroscience through forms of algorithm and machine 
          learning to help both communities better understand the machines and ourselves. I am also trying to 
          be a <strong>master of puzzle solving</strong> to use an algoritmic approach to solve np-hard problems in different domains. 
          I am fluent in both Chinese and English, and open-minded for new ideas and learning opportunities.

          <p>The modern paradigm of machine learning puts the emphasis on the end result, 
            rather than the learning process, and overlooks a critical characteristic of human 
            learning: that it is robust to changing tasks and sequential experience.</p>

        <p>
          I am currently researching into the theoretical aspects of <strong>Continual Learning</strong> with advising from professor 
          <a href="https://scungao.github.io/" target="_blank">Sichun Gao</a> from UCSD Computer Science & Engineering Department 
          and professor <a href="https://talmopereira.com/" target="_blank">Talmo Pereira</a> from Salk Institute. I try to frame the general problem of 
          Continual Learning from the perspective of Reinforcement Learning & Cognitive Neuroscience, hoping to develop algorithms 
          that utilize the same strategies of "how we learn" onto an artificial agent.

        <h2>Salk Institute Research Intern</h2>

        <p>
            I am currently working as an undergraduate research intern at 
            <a href="https://talmolab.org/" target="_blank">Talmo's Lab</a> in the Salk Institute. We are working on the VNL project, 
            a collaboration between Salk Institute and Harvard University aiming to use advanced 
            <strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong> methods such as <strong>Imitation Learning</strong> to create working 
            pipelines for computational models of the brain using GPU accelerated JAX & Brax.

        <p>
            We aim to create pipelines with architectures and learning algorithms that are capable of generalizing and 
            continual learning of low-level skills that are transferable for multiple higher-level task-driven goals, 
            trying to get closer to what the "real brain" is capable of doing.

            I researched on Affordance Embodied Simulation’s presences in <strong>Multimodal Models</strong> through the UCSD Faculty Mentorship Program (Sep 2023 - Jun 2024) under the supervision of 
            <a href="https://seantrott.github.io/">Sean Trott</a>. We try to improve the reliability of machine learning models through examining the degree of models’ “understanding” of the subtle 
            keys in human languages and how it is used to map the world we know.

        <h1>Data Science Projects</h1>

        <h2>Intuitive Laplacien Eigenmap Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            Dimensionality reduction technique is a crucial technique in machine learning as they are an approach in finding the "principals" in high dimensional data, which tends to be very noisy and would affect 
            the accuracy of simple classifier significantly. However, these techniques are usually very mathematically intense and complicated for the general public to understand without prior mathematical background. 
            Therefore, we developed this visualization project using D3, JavaScript to deliver an <strong>intuitive</strong> understanding of one of the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms (<strong>Laplacien Eigenmap</strong>) 
            on the art work collections in MET, New York.

        <h2>Robust Ensemble Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Recipes and ratings play a pivotal role in our everyday lives, influencing various aspects from culinary experiences to social interactions. Predicting users’ preferences is particularly crucial as it enables 
            personalized experiences and enhances efficiency in content discovery. In our analysis, we focus on how to predict user preferences based on various numerical and textual features. Our approach involves employing advanced 
            techniques such as TF-IDF transformation, PCA, and a homogenous ensemble learning method, specifically Random Forest, to construct a reliable multi-class classifier with more <strong>robust</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong> predictions 
            even facing imbalanced datasets, ensuring dependable predictions in scenarios where data distribution is skewed.
