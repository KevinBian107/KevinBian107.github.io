            I think addiction's neural circuit is one that is pretty interesting to look at because it demonstarte a systematic method of adaptation to deviation, an well rounded circular circuit that feeds into each 
            other to achieve the adaptation that has an cost, that deviate from normal function. More importantly, I think it may serve as a model that can help us to undersand how adaptation works on a neuronal level that may effect how we think, feel, and do on the cognition level, how 
            higher level cognition may stem from basic biological units that continuously reevaluates the needs in the environment and readjust the body's parameter to fit such needs.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Allostatic Processes: Nueral Adapttaion With Cost</h2>

        <p>
            I want to introduce the idea of addictio through the perspective of Allostasis, which I will intriduce first. <strong>Homeostasis</strong>, the perspective of deeming how biological system works as a restoration of balance, of an setpoint, may be one that is too ideal to 
            impose to our body sometimes. It assumes a perfect senerio, an egineering system that is imposed onto biology. <strong>Allostasis</strong>, on the other hand, involves a feed-forward mechanism and describes "stability through chanegs". 
            In the Allostasis hypothesis, the feed-forward allows the matching and adjustment to the environment through continuous reevaluation of needs and continuous readjustment of all parameters toward the new set points. 
            However, when the body is under states that "we don't exactly want to adapt to", the ability to quickly mobilize resources and use feed-forward mechanisms to adapt to the environment can lead to some issues, the <strong>cost of neural adaptation</strong>.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>An allostatic state can be defined as a state of chronic deviation of the regulatory system from its normal (homeostatic) operating level</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Koob and Le Moal (2001)</p>

        <p>
            The same circuit that help us adapt to an new environent quickly and adjust ourselves may be the same one that leads to allostatic load, allostatic state, or ultimately pathology under extreme conditions. Allostatic mechanims have long being hypothesized to be 
            regulating and maintaining motivational systems that have relevance to the pathology of additction.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                An acute elevation of blood pressure is ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù in an allostasis model to meet the environmental demand of acute arousal, but chronic blood pressure elevations under conditions of chronic stress may address the chronic environmental 
                demand but is certainly not healthy.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Sterling and Eyer (1988)</p>

        <p>The circuit of addiction spans across multiple area and doing multiple things all at once, aligning with the whole theme of "all the area, all the functions, all the state, all at once". Using the conceptual framework layed out in Koob and Schulkin's paper, 
          addiction is mainly separtated to 3 stages: <strong>Intoxination</strong>, <strong>Negative Reinforcing</strong>, and <strong>Preoccupation</strong> and each stage have circuits that is specifically for them but also feeding in into other stages. For example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Basal Ganglia (blue structure) is relevant to the Intoxination stage with the activation of various neurotransmitters such as dopamine and opiod peptide, engaging asscoiative mechanism with nucleus accumbens shell, and making an stimulus to response 
                habits engaging the dorsal striatum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In the Negative Reinforcing stage, the extended amygdala (red structures) is highly activated that supports the whole feed forward system to deviate from the original set point.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Then during the Preoccupation period (green structure), hippocampus, executive function areas like Prefrontal Cortex would all be engaged with active seacrhing sensor areas like orbital and anterior cingulate cortices and temporal lobe.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        </blockquote>

        <h2>Too Much of a Good Thing May be Bad</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Motivation is a construct that can be defined as ‚Äúa state that varies with arousal and guides behavior in relationship to changes in the environment. The environment can be external (incentives) or internal (central motive states or drives), and such motivation or motivational states are not constants and vary over time‚Äù.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Koob et al. (2010)</p>

        <p>
          Interestingly, such state that varies with arousal may be quite correlated with how stress we are. Some levels of stress can be rewarding and boost learning as we know that Cortical Releasing Factor (CRF) (think it as stress hormone) may help us to spring to actions, lowering the sensory threshold, and enhance learning as it have involvement in attentional responses to both external and internal events that increases incentive salience. However, 
          excessive stress feeds our body into the vicious cycle and may leads to pathology. Interestingly, the excess of reward may do the same.
        </p>

        <h3>HPA Axis & Glucocorticoid</h3>

        <p>
          An classic response to stress is the activation of the HPA axis. CRF-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus would release CRF into the portal system, activates the release of ACTH from the pituitary, which in turn activates the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. 
          This is one of the brain's attempt to restore balances as glucocorticoid activation may decrease CRF gene expression, which leads to less CRF. However, this is already a neuroadaptations that initiate the allostatic process, one that deviates from the original point (notice that deviation is perfectly normal as 
          we need to adapt to changes, but a systematic deviation that causes too great of a shift may be causing some issues).
        </p>

        <p>
          Back to addiction, drug would initiates similar effect that stimulate the HPA Axis with ACTH release and establishing the whole down stream effect that can be caused with mild stress described above. In some sense, it seems like stress and reward does both trigger similar activations that causes the reduction in CRH, which 
          makes one feel good. However, the difference being the amount of  neurotransmitter that is released, which links to the issues with Negative Reinforcing.
        </p>

        <h3>Negative Reinforcing: Residual Hysteresis</h3>

        <p>
          The massive release of reward neurotransmitters (causing the downstream effect mentioned previously) comes with drug-opposite responses as the drug wears off. Because of the magnitute of neurotransmitter release, such opponent processes have been hypothesized to occur even with a single injection of a drug. 
          If the intake is persistant, then the bar with feeling rewarding would be raised and the elevation of reward thresholds never returns to baseline levels (residual hysteresis), progressively creating greater elevation of the ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù reward thresholds and leading to more compulsize liek drug seeking (addiction). Remanber that CRH 
          may boost our learning because it have involvement in attentional responses to both external and internal events that increases incentive salience? Well, the same phenomenon would occur for deugs, the attentional salience map for this object (drug) wouuld be elevated and the "value" of such object is also over-estimated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Negative Reinforcing (Koob and Schulkin (2019))</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In the same fashion, the Negative Reinforsing stage feed back into the Intoxination stage as well where such massive release of neurotransmitter from drugs effects are associated with adaptations such as decreases in dopaminergic transmission and dopaminergic neuron firing in the ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens, and Ventral Tagemental Area, causing the lack of 
          needed dopamine signal when needed. As well known, Dopamine is an key neural transmitter in encoding reward signal, so if there exist a adaptation of systematic deviation, issues would occur (this adaptation is somewhat also raising the bar becuase the body thinks that not as much dopamine is really needed because of the new given condition). Molecular adaptation with 
          G-protein functioning and protein kinase A activity in the nucleus accumbens also occurs to consolidate these changes that occurs between-systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Preoccupation: PFC Being Offline</h3>

        <p>
          The Preprontal cortes is usually deemed as a key for executive function and coognitive decision making (i.e. smart choices of not doing drugs). The activation of the HPA axis and the CRF system would negatively impacts the prefrontal cortex to impair such top-down connectivity and boost allostatic changes in the extended amygdala. 
          Now there is a decrease in the inhibitory function of the prefrontal cortex (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex) and a boosting in the extended amygdala, the habitual mode mentioned in the other article would start to occur, leading to further preoccupation of drug stimuli.
        </p>

        <p>Now you may begin to have some intuition of how these 3 stages work independently on its own but also feeding in to each other to create such trap of addiction.</p>
