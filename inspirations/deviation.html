            I think addiction's neural circuit is one that is pretty interesting to look at because it demonstarte a systematic method of adaptation to deviation, an well rounded circular circuit that feeds into each 
            other to achieve the adaptation that has an cost, that deviate from normal function. More importantly, I think it may serve as a model that can help us to undersand how adaptation works on a neuronal level that may effect how we think, feel, and do on the cognition level, how 
            higher level cognition may stem from basic biological units that continuously reevaluates the needs in the environment and readjust the body's parameter to fit such needs.

        <h2>Allostatic Processes: Nueral Adapttaion With Cost</h2>

        <p>
            I want to introduce the idea of addictio through the perspective of Allostasis, which I will intriduce first. <strong>Homeostasis</strong>, the perspective of deeming how biological system works as a restoration of balance, of an setpoint, may be one that is too ideal to 
            impose to our body sometimes. It assumes a perfect senerio, an egineering system that is imposed onto biology. <strong>Allostasis</strong>, on the other hand, involves a feed-forward mechanism and describes "stability through chanegs". 
            In the Allostasis hypothesis, the feed-forward allows the matching and adjustment to the environment through continuous reevaluation of needs and continuous readjustment of all parameters toward the new set points. 
            However, when the body is under states that "we don't exactly want to adapt to", the ability to quickly mobilize resources and use feed-forward mechanisms to adapt to the environment can lead to some issues, the <strong>cost of neural adaptation</strong>.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>An allostatic state can be defined as a state of chronic deviation of the regulatory system from its normal (homeostatic) operating level</p>

        <p>Koob and Le Moal (2001)</p>

        <p>
            The same circuit that help us adapt to an new environent quickly and adjust ourselves may be the same one that leads to allostatic load, allostatic state, or ultimately pathology under extreme conditions. Allostatic mechanims have long being hypothesized to be 
            regulating and maintaining motivational systems that have relevance to the pathology of additction.

            <p>
                An acute elevation of blood pressure is ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù in an allostasis model to meet the environmental demand of acute arousal, but chronic blood pressure elevations under conditions of chronic stress may address the chronic environmental 
                demand but is certainly not healthy.
